# Locales

KeyboardKit defines keyboard-specific locales and provides localized content for the supported locales.


## Keyboard Locale

KeyboardKit has a `KeyboardLocale` enum with these locales:

* ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ English (US - Default)

* ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡° Danish
* ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± Dutch
* ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ English (UK)
* ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ English (US)
* ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡® Finnish
* ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· French
* ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª German
* ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ Italian
* ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´ Norwegian
* ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Swedish
* ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spanish

More locales will be added in the future.


## Localized strings

KeyboardKit has a `KKL10n` enum that provides localized texts for all locales. These texts are used to localize certain buttons, labels etc.

Localized texts are managed under `Sources/Resources`.


## Adding new locales

Keyboard locales does not just involve localized strings.

Adding a new locale to KeyboardKit requires the following:

* Define the new `KeyboardLocale` case
* Define its properties, like `flag`, `isLeftToRight` etc.
* Provide a `Resources/<id>.lproj` folder.
* Implement a custom `KeyboardInputSetProvider`.
* Implement a custom `SecondaryCalloutActionProvider`.

If the locale has a keyboard layout that differs from the English 10-9-7 layout or the German 11-11-7 layouts, a new `KeyboardLayoutProvider` must be specified.

Custom keyboard locales must ensure that the keyboard layout is correct for:

* locale
* iPhone portrait
* iPhone landscape
* iPad portrait
* iPad landscape  

This involves specifying margins, system actions etc. to make the keyboard behave correctly for all these cases.


## KeyboardKit Pro

KeyboardKit Pro defines input sets and secondary actions for all keyboard locales.
