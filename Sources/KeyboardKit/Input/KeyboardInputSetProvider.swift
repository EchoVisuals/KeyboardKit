/**
 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to provide a keyboard layout with input sets.
 
 An input set defines the input keys on a keyboard. The keys
 can then be used to create a layout, which defines the full
 set of keys, described as layout items.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically create a standard instance
 when the keyboard input view controller is created. You can
 use the standard instance as is or replace it with a custom
 one if you want to customize your keyboard.
