/**
 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to provide autocomplete suggestions for a certain text.
 
 You can implement the protocol in any way you like, e.g. to
 use a built-in database or by connecting to an external api.
 Note that network operations require full access and can be
 slow for your users.
 
 The KeyboardKit Pro `StandardAutocompleteProvider` provider
 can be unlocked with a license. KeyboardKit Pro also has an
 `ExternalAutocompleteProvider` provider that can be used to
 communicate with an external api or web service.
