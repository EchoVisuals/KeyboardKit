/**
 This class provides keyboard extensions with contextual and
 observable information. It's a central part of KeyboardKit.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically create an instance of this
 context and bind it to the main input view controller.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically sync this context with the
 controller whenever needed. This means that any significant
 changes will be synced to `@Published` properties that your
 extension can observe to drive UI changes.
