/**
 This file contains keyboard-specific color extensions.
 
 These contextual colors may appear to be resolved in a very
 strange way, but the reason is that iOS currently has a bug
 that cause `colorScheme` to become incorrect when editing a
 keyboard with `keyboardAppearance` set to `dark`. This will
 set the `colorScheme` of the extension to `dark`, even when
 the system is `light`.
 
 To work around this bug, the button background colors use a
 temporary color set with the suffix `ForColorSchemeBug`. It
 uses dark mode colors that are semi-transparent white, with
 an opacity that makes them look good in both light mode and
 dark appearance and dark mode.
 
 For now, the `Color.darkAppearanceStrategy` property can be
 used to customize whether or not to use dark appearance.
